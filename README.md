# dataScienceFromScratch
An attempt to do basic data science with Javascript. Formulas are Javascript copies of the Python examples from the book *Data Science from Scratch* from O'Reilly.
Goal is not to beat python performance by any means, merely to have it all working in the front end and make it possible to do basic interaction with these tools, and maybe later on, have some graphical interaction as (ie using D3) as well.
